The current revenue model of the internet reduces our vibrant subcultures to 1-dimensional infinite content feeds, forcing culture's creators to compete against each other for attention. And while the worlds attention has centralized around a few platforms, there's been a rise in cultural attachment as a primary selling point given the near unlimited optionality in products and services. Thus creators are sponsored to push their fans to consume products and services from companies that are only interested in profit. Creators command a huge amount of attention in the world, but their cultural influence is co-opted by corporations for soulless ends. 


The millions of artists, athletes, and creators building subcultures all around the world are unable to come together in a positive sum way around the value they're creating. Most struggle to make money, and the ones that do sell out their fans via sponsorships. Unlike a company, all participants in the creator economy are operating in [single player mode](https://www.metalabel.xyz/what-is-metalabel). Outside of setting up a shared bank account and legal structure that requires a large amount of trust, groups of creators do not have the means to economically rally behind their subcultures and collectively command the economic energy they generate. Instead, for profit brands reap the majority of benefits and creators are left to compete in the infinite-feed arena.


On the consumer side, the reality today is the average person is thrown into a system of mindless scrolling and consumption, constantly feeding a system that exploits them for profit. There's currently no way for consumers to get decision making power and meaningfully exert influence over the money they're spending. Instead, the majority of economic energy is fueled into more consumption, more ads, and the people have limited power to make changes they care about.


These brands and companies are structurally disincentivized to make meaningful impact in improving subcultures they profit from. The majority of people are fed up with brands and companies that don't align with their values, but have no real alternative. Most feel brands make empty promises, and are only interested in profit. At the same time, most people are actually willing to pay for alternatives that align with their view of the world and have positive impact. 


Creators and consumers are the ones that push culture forward, generate value, and develop meaningful visions for world change, but for-profit companies have always been in the drivers seat, until now. The rise of token networks, internet subcultures, creator fanbases, DAOs, and other forms of community ownership are showing the way to a new world order. Nouns DAO, a community owned headless brand, has raised over $50m to build public goods and proliferate the Nouns brand globally ⌐◨-◨. Bitcoin bootstrapped a $1t monetary network owned by the people. A group of thousands of strangers raised $40m to buy the Constitution. Patagonia recently pledged to donate all of its profits every year to save the planet. MrBeast's fanbase raised $20m to plant 20m trees. The tides are shifting from mindless consumption to a place of shared value creation, meaningful communal participation, and social impact.


We are building the Revolution Protocol for this new world order. Revolution empowers communities to collectively build and own their culture's future. The protocol enables the creation of decentralized brands, built and owned by the people, able to create positive change in the world on their own terms. It marks a paradigm shift in how people create shared value on the internet, and has the potential to flip our capitalist profit maximizing system on its head.


The platform itself is a full stack economic engine for subcultural cultivation and social impact. Communities are empowered to come together, engage, and drive attention to the culture they're creating. Everyone in the community can earn money for themselves and a shared treasury by selling co-branded drops of goods, services, and NFTs. Crucially, any money earned for the community earns both the creator and supporter governance rights over the funds. The community can then collectively decide how to spend the money in the shared treasury, and can use it to fund projects, causes, and other initiatives.


Anyone is able to build on the brand. This permissionless innovation paired with governance emission to the people building and supporting the brand creates an incredibly powerful feedback loop for people to contribute to the growth of the brand. The more people contribute, the more the brand grows, the more money everyone earns, and the more positive impact the brand can have in the world.


We call this the revolution cycle. It's the future our cultures deserve, and we believe it's the revolution we've all been waiting for.
